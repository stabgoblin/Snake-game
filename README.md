# Snake-game
If you want to play this game, download all files<br>
Then double click the game.exe file<br>
I made this game to learn about raylib, <br>
I followed this tutorial https://youtu.be/LGqsnM_WEK4?si=H0tYDpJVCrNk-ODd <br>
and I added some extra features <br>
If you want to make changes to original game then you should have g++ in your global path<br>
then open powershell and run ./run.ps1<br>
this should compile the game, for any feedbacks please contact me.
